# Random BOFH Excuse generator.
This is a small ruby/sinatra app that displays one or more BOFH-style excuses.
(See [here](https://www.theregister.co.uk/data_centre/bofh/) if you're not familiar with the BOFH)

It randomly selects the required number of excuses from a one-excuse-per-line text file `bofh_excuses.txt`.
